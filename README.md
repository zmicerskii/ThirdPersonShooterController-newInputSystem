# Third Person Shooter Controller (new Input System)
<h3>The controller is based on the "<a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-third-person-character-controller-196526#description" >Starter Assets</a>", but the code has been modified and refactored a little.</h3>
<h3>The character can: stand, walk, run, jump, sit down, get up, aim, shoot bullets (pool), reloading, die, and also respawn, a system for taking damage is prescribed (depending on the body part).</h3>
<h3>Added a little UI: on top the logos of the teams and the score of the game (not active yet), on the bottom the level of health and the number of bullets (working).</h3>
<h3>Uses a virtual camera (Chinmachine).</h3>
<h3>Added sounds of shots and reloading (ScriptableObject).</h3>
<h3>Animations and character model are taken from mixamo.com. The model and type of animation are Generic.</h3>
<h3>There are also two primitive locations (a bridge and a hangar).</h3>
